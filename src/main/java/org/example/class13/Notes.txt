Methods in java:
    Methods are block of code that do something when we call them.
    They can take input(arguments/parameters) and they can also
    return data back.
Why should we use methods?
    Methods help us save code repetition in multiple classes.
    Loops helps us to prevent repetition only in the same class.

Syntax Of Method:
    return Type nameOfMethod(Parameters){

    }

    void add(int a,int b){
    sout (a+b);

    }
