Access Modifiers:
    Access modifiers are basically keywords in java that
    help us control what can be accessed outside
    a class like fields and methods.
    private: everyone cannot access this
    protected: if you have to use it within the class
    public: anyone can access even if they are ina different package
    Static: we used when we create nested classes (class within a class)
Constructors:
    Constructors help us build the object of a class easily. They
    are a special block of code which is created to give initial
    values to the instance variables.

    1) We do not write any written type for constructors
    2) It cannot have any other name other than the class

Whenever we write static with a method we can just write the class name to access it.
We do not have to create an object for it.
