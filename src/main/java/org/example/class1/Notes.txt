Variable Rules:
1) We can't use the same name for 2 or
more variables within the same class.
EG. We cannot do this:
int age=20;
float age=20.3;
2) We can't have spaces in the names of the variables.
EG. int my age=20;
3) Variable names can't start with
numbers or special characters. We can end it though.
4) Every line must end with ";" or ")"

All classes start with Upper Case Letter

Packages methods and variables start with a Lower
Case Letter.

For paragraph comments
/* blah blah
blah blah
b lah blah
