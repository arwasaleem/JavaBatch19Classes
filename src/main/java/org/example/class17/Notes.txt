Inheritance:
    It is one of the main pillars of OOPs. It allows one class to
    acquire the fields and the properties of another class.

Why should we use Inheritance?
    It helps us save a lot of code repetitions. When we are creating multiple closely related classes
    We should create a parent class and put the code in it.

Rules:
    1) All the private members (instance vars,method) Can't be used
    through inheritance.

Types of inheritance:
    Single, hierarchical, Multi-level and Multiple.
    Java does not support multiple because the child class has multiple parents and it will
    be confusing.

SuperKeyword:
    To access instance variable if the parent and child class have members with the same name.
    It helps you access the variable directly from the parent class
    "this" keyword lets you access only from the immediate parent
