Scanner Class:
    Scanner is a class that helps us take input data from the user
    from the keyboard. Just like scanner class we have so many other
    classes that we can use from Java and other libraries.

    These classes are divided into methods, each method can do something
    useful. Like nextInt(), nextBoolean(), nextDouble().

Logical Operators:
    Used to combine multiple conditions. There are 3 logical operators in java:
    1) Logical NOT "!"
    It reverses the situation (true becomes false and vice-versa)
    2) Logical AND "&&"
    3) Logical OR "||"

Switch Statements:
for equality statement types always try to use switch instead of ifElseIf

Important Notes:
    Every Class in java also acts as a data type. We can
    create variables of these classes.
    If we want to reuse some codes from a class, we can create its objects
    and then we can start calling those methods.
