Loops in programming:
    Loops help us execute a block of code again and again
    until a condition is met, Once the condition is met the loop stops.

Fundamentals:
    A Loop should always have
    1) variable
    2) starting point
    3) condition
    4) increment/decrement operator

Why should we use loops?
    To end up with a scalable code. We cannot write the same code multiple times.
    So to avoid code redundancy

* Operators we use ++, --
* We use "do" and "while" when using loops
* In "while" we check the condition first
* In "do" we execute the code first
* Most widely use loop is "for" loop
